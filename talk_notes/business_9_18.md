    - Uncover inefficiencies
    - See value others don't see
    - Quantify tradeoffs (make right decisions)
    - Scale efficiently
- Money = objective in optimization problem
- Problems math can solve
    - pricing things
    - data analysis 
    - prediction models
- protecting against shocks to the market.

### Computational Advertising
- Auction takes place for ad spot on your screen based on cookie information. 
- Publisher of website has two different contracts
    - Guaranteed contracts for ads
    - Ad exchange (i.e., Google, Yahoo, etc.) which then hold auctions with real-time bidders. 
    - Publisher decides what frequency of ads should be guaranteed bidders and auction winners
    - Because price is more flexible for an auction with less information (wider margin) you'll have a thicker market; more people will participate. If you have an auction with more info, your margins will be tighter and you'll have fewer people interested (who may be willing to pay more) -- price is not fixed. 
        - I'd expect more information to lead to a thicker market, which then narrows margins. However, this pre-assumes that people all want to participate in all auctions. But there's no benefit for an advertiser to participate in an auction for someone who is not in the target audience. More information is not necessarily better. (In the market, market makers get commission for every trade they can put to market).
