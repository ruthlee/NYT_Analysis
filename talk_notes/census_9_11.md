## Overview
- Community Mapping Assistance Program (CMAP) makes maps for data 
- Census data used to determine federal budget allocation
    - allocate congressional/legistative representation 
- Dicennial census happens every 10 yrs by constitution

## How Census Bureau Counts us
1. Self-response either through emailed or mailed questionairre
    - most accurate/complete pop data submitted in this phase
1. Non-response follow up phase
    - bureau hires 100s of ppl to go door to door to count every household that didn't self respond 
    - more expensive
    - biggest risk of miscounting or missing ppl 

## Progress
- Online "hard to count" map for 2010 Census 
    - assign a score to each census tract based on factors which lead to more non-respondence 
- identify populations at risk of being undercounted
    - people of color
    - children under 5
    - renter
    - etc.

## Ways to go beyond
- Excel list of tracts with detailed population estimates
- compare tract data to pdf map of county/borough
- spatial analysis, maybe using GIS (computer mapping software) 
- HTC 2020 website has data download source for every state. 
- Goals: analyzing information in different ways from traditional "get out the count" methods
    - new insights to patterns
- main challenge to getting a fair 2020 census is advocacy- advertising importance of census ppl

## Questions
- how can we deploy resources most efficiently in self-response phase and afterwards in hard to count regions? 
- A lot of people don't like filling questionairre online- would prefer paper.
