## Overview
- Community Mapping Assistance Program (CMAP) makes maps for data 
- Census data used to determine federal budget allocation
    - allocate congressional/legistative representation 
- Dicennial census happens every 10 yrs by constitution

## How Census Bureau Counts us
1. Self-response either through emailed or mailed questionairre
    - most accurate/complete pop data submitted in this phase
1. Non-response follow up phase
    - bureau hires 100s of ppl to go door to door to count every household that didn't self respond 
    - more expensive
    - biggest risk of miscounting or missing ppl 

## Progress
- Online "hard to count" map for 2010 Census 
    - assign a score to each census tract based on factors which lead to more non-respondence 
- identify populations at risk of being undercounted
    - people of color
    - children under 5
    - renter
    - etc.
