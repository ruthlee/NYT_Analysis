# Final Project for APAM 4903 Senior Applied Math Seminar

Current idea:

1. Build a dataset: corpus of work from different (NYtimes?) reporters
    - Word to vec
    - Data analysis of style, language features, etc.
2. Identify engagement metrics
    - Article retweets (sum them over reporters?)
    - Journalist followers
3. Analyze models and link 1 and 2 (identify drivers of 2 from 1)

Questions
- How much data do we need? How many reporters?
- Does a database like this already exist (almost certainly - get wiggins to introduce us to Mike Hansen)
